----------

  

### About

  

**CPU Visualizer** is an interactive, visual simulation of a simple CPU design.

The goal of this project is to show how CPU instructions are processed internally.

  

Every wire carries a value, and every logic gate is fully simulated.

  

----------

  

### Exploring the CPU

  

You can click on individual CPU components to view their internal diagrams.

Some components are still a work in progress, but most are functional.

  

Click on wires to inspect their current values in real time.

  

----------

  

### Writing Instructions

  

In the side menu on the left, you’ll find a code editor.

Enter the instructions you want to simulate, then press **Execute** to run the program.

  

If you’re new, try running the default program to get familiar with how the CPU behaves.

More detailed information about the instruction format can be found in the **Program** tab.

  

----------

  

### Code Execution

  

After executing your program, you can step through individual CPU cycles using the controls at the bottom of the page.

  

The currently executing instruction is displayed as the simulation runs.

### Bugs & Feedback

  

This project is still in its early stages, so bugs are expected.

  

- Seeing incorrect values on wires?

- Experiencing issues with the code editor?

- Noticing something wrong with the circuit diagram?
